# Brevity Trainer

I really value soft skills like communication. But I struggle a lot with being concise. I created this site to help train brevity with an excercise I learned while writing cold-emails. Basically, you cut the number of words in your email/speech by 50% each time. 

If you want to try out the exercise, visit the site [here](https://brevity-trainer.web.app)
